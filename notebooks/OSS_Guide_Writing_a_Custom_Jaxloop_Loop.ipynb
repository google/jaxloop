        "Jaxloop comprises five key parts: model, datasets, steps, inner loops, and outer loop. To construct an experiment using Jaxloop, follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define the Model:**  Specify the architecture and functionality of your machine learning model.\n",
        "2. **Define Datasets:**  Prepare your training and evaluation data, ensuring proper formatting and loading procedures.\n",
        "3. **Define Steps:**  Create individual functions for distinct operations, such as calculating loss, updating parameters, or evaluating metrics. In Keras terms, a step is similar to an \"iteration\" - a single forward and backward pass on a batch of data.\n",
        "4. **Define Inner Loops:**  Combine steps into iterative processes, like a training loop that updates model parameters over multiple batches of data or evaluation loops that assesses the performance of your model parameters. In Keras, an inner loop is analogous to an \"epoch\" - one complete pass through the entire dataset (or one pass of a given number of data samples).\n",
        "5. **Define and Invoke the Outer Loop:**  Orchestrate the overall experimental workflow, potentially encompassing multiple inner loops for training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. In Keras, this is similar to the overall \"training loop\" that encompasses all epochs.\n",

        "# Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "In Jaxloop, a \"step\" refers to a modular unit of computation that processes a batch of data from your dataset. Each step is defined as a class inheriting from `jaxloop.Step`, and its core logic resides within the `run` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of key aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`run` function:** This is the heart of a Jaxloop step. You, as the user, are responsible for implementing this function to define how a batch of data is processed. This could involve anything from computing the loss and gradients to updating model parameters or calculating evaluation metrics.\n",
        "* **Train vs. Eval Steps:** A Jaxloop step can be designated as either a training step or an evaluation step. This distinction is controlled by a boolean input parameter. The implementation of the `run` function will typically differ between train and eval steps, reflecting the different tasks they perform.\n",
        "* **Outputs:** The `run` function returns two values:\n",
        "    * `train_state`:  An object containing the current state of your model and optimizer.\n",
        "    * `output`: A dictionary (with string keys) where you can store any data relevant to the step's execution, such as loss values, accuracy metrics, gradients, or anything else you need to track.\n",
        "* **JIT Compilation and Sharding:** To maximize performance, Jaxloop automatically compiles your `run` function using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and distributes the computation across multiple devices (if available) using a technique called sharding. The specific sharding strategy is determined by a \"partitioner\" object, which we'll discuss in more detail later.\n",
        "* **`begin` and `end` functions:**  Jaxloop provides optional `begin` and `end` functions that you can implement within your step class. These functions allow you to perform pre-processing or post-processing operations on the `train_state` and `output` before and after the `run` function is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "By encapsulating different stages of your training and evaluation pipeline into these modular steps, Jaxloop promotes code organization, reusability, and flexibility in designing your experiments."
